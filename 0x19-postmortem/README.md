0x19. Postmortem

Using one of the web stack debugging project issue or an outage you have personally face, write a postmortem. Most of you will never have faced an outage, so just get creative and invent your own :)

Requirements:

Issue Summary (that is often what executives will read) must contain:
duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone)
what was the impact (what service was down/slow? What were user experiencing? How many % of the users were affected?)
what was the root cause
